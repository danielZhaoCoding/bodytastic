quotes='["Ask yourself if what you are doing today is getting you closer to where you want to be tomorrow","You may not be there yet, but you are closer than you were yesterday","Do something today that your future self will thank you for","The only bad workout is the one that didn`t happen","A little progress each day adds up to big results","First they will laugh. Then they will copy. Don’t give up","Don’t be afraid of being a beginner","I may not be there yet, but I’m closer than I was yesterday","Remember, Rome wasn’t built in a day. Work hard, good results will come","Less sugar, more fruit. Less soda, more water. Less driving, more walking. Less worry, more sleep. Less words, more action","Nothing truly great ever came from a comfort zone","Believe in yourself and all that you are. Know that there is something inside of you that is greater than any obstacle","Don’t limit your challenges, challenge your limits","Obstacles can’t stop you. Problems can’t stop you. People can’t stop you. Only you can stop you","When you feel like quitting think about why you started","No pain, no gain. Shut up and train","If you cheat, you are only cheating yourself"]';
